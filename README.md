# Clinical-subset at Single-cell
A small subset of clinical data from the lab was used.
The script khanna-lab.r was prepared, in which the main results produced at each step were pasted for reference.
Since the data belonged to a third party, it could not be shared.

The iCellR package was used instead of Seurat.

The main objective was to examine marker gene expression across clusters in order to determine biological similarities. Based on these patterns, decisions were made regarding which clusters could be merged or refined.
